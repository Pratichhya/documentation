# Applications

This section provides an overview of the EO Applications available from Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.


## [Browser](/Applications/Browser.md) 

The Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem Browser serves as a central hub for accessing, exploring and utilizing the wealth of Earth observation and environmental data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel constellations, contributing missions, Auxiliary engineering data, on-demand data and more (Check out the documentation on [Data](/Data.md) for more details) . Based on Sentinel Hub's EO Browser, users can visualise, compare and analyse and download all this data for a variety of applications, from environmental monitoring and disaster management to urban planning and agriculture. Check out the user guide to know more about the features of the Browser and how to use it.
## [openEO algorithm plaza](/Applications/AlgorithmPlaza.qmd)

The openEO algorithm plaza host many algorithms that are built on top of the openEO API. These algorithms also termed as Earth Observation services can be addressed via openEO Web Editor or via API to embed into new services or platforms. Users are granted with credits to explore the available algorithms and check if they are fit for purpose for their needs. The plaza not only allows to explore the services but also enables third party services provider to onboard their algorithms semi-automatically for further exposure.
