# Sentinel 2


## Description
The [Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) comprises a land monitoring constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites placed in the same sun-synchronous orbit, phased at 180° to each other. It aims at monitoring variability in land surface conditions, and its wide swath width (290 km) and high revisit time (10 days at the equator with one satellite, and 5 days with 2 satellites under cloud-free conditions which results in 2-3 days at mid-latitudes) will support monitoring of Earth's surface changes.

The [Sentinel-2 products](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/data-products) are a compilation of elementary granules of fixed size, along with a single orbit. A granule is the minimum indivisible partition of a product (containing all possible spectral bands).

For Level-1C and Level-2A, the granules, also called tiles, are 100x100 km2 ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection. Download the Sentinel-2 tiling grid km.

The UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) system divides the Earth's surface into 60 zones. Each UTM zone has a vertical width of 6° of longitude and horizontal width of 8° of latitude.

Note: The initial offer as from Jan-23 includes IAD access to the original Sentinel-2 Level-2A products generated by the ESA Copernicus Ground Segment for data acquired since xxx. 
For Sentinel-2 data acquired before xxx:
-	the initial offer in IAD (Immediately available data) includes  Sentinel-2 Level-2A products generated by ESA Copernicus Ground Segment and also Level-2A products generated by the Creodias using the Sentinel-2 Toolbox. 
-	Access to the original Sentinel-2 Level-2A products generated by ESA Copernicus Ground Segment will be available in DAD (Deferred available data) as from xxx 

In addition. IAD access to the new Collection-1 for the Sentinel-2 Level-2A products generated by the ESA Copernicus Ground Segment for all Sentinel-2 data will be available gradually as part of the Sentinel-2 reprocessing campaign.   

The table below indicates for each type of user level product, the format in which the data will be available, the access type (IAD or DAD), the spatial and temporal extent of the offer and from when the data will be available in the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem. 
The data offer will gradually extend starting from January 2023.
