The openEO algorithm plaza allows to use and share an algorithm or workflow as a service to the user community. Being an online Application Programming Interface (API) and integrations, openEO algorithm plaza provides a self-service portal through which customers, internal staff, and external providers can interact, publish, and use integrations easily in one place.

From a user's prespective, it simplifies the IT aspects of publishing service so that you can entirely focus on the algorithm's development.The openEO algorithm plaza relies on standardised web interfaces, so our users can easily access your service. A visual description of the service is published to give an attractive overview of the capabilities. Whereas as a service provider, publishing an algorithm as a service will give it greater visibility and expose it to a larger audience who can use them and provide feedbacks.

## Signing in 

<!-- link to documnet showing how to signin, create account, manage your organization and profile. -->
If you haven't previously registered and created an account, you need to click on the ```Register``` navigation option on the main openEO algorithm plaza portal landing page and this will launch the registration flow.

You arrive at this page by being unauthenticated and clicking on the ```Sign In``` navigation option. 
Through this flow, any user can login into their registered account after they have successfully validated their email address through the link sent to their email.

In order to use the services on the openEO algorithm plaza, it is advised to use the ```Edugain & social logins```.
This will start a one time process to link your Terrascope account to your institution or social media credentials.

We rely on the authentication and authorization service
[EGI check-in](https://www.egi.eu/services/check-in/),
provided by the [EGI Foundation](https://egi.eu). 
It allows you to log in through an **existing account** from either your institution or other commonly used (social) platforms such as Google, GitHub, Facebook or LinkedIn.

<blockquote class="tip"><p>Tip: Some background on Security & Privacy.</p>

This procedure has important advantages for users.
* Neither we, nor the EGI Foundation see, handle or store your password. It is only exchanged directly with your institution or the selected (social) platforms, to minimize the risk of leaking sensitive credentials.
* We only retain minimal information about our users, such as email address and a few more general attributes.
* There is no need to set up and remember yet another username and password.
</blockquote>

### Connect an existing account

The next step is to connect your existing account with EGI check-in and become a member of the *EGI User community*.

To get an idea of ​​what this step will require from you,
you can consult the [EGI Documentation](https://docs.egi.eu/documentation/333/users/check-in/signup/), which contains a step-by-step guide with pictures.
If problems occur during this process, feel free to send a support request to `check-in <at> egi.eu`.

<blockquote class="tip"><p>Tip: You have already connected your account in the past?</p>
If you have already done so, you don't need to do so again and you can just continue.
If you don't remember whether you already have connected your account, you can simply try to follow the steps below.
If it is already connected, you will get a warning at the end of the process: "The identifier is already in use".
</blockquote>

To get started, please go to <https://aai.egi.eu/signup>. You will have to select the
institution (recommended) or the (social) platform you want to log in with in the future
and follow the login procedure.

<blockquote class="warning"><p>Recommendation</p>
We recommend using your institutional account whenever possible.
Be aware that if you are the first member of your institution to work with EGI check-in, 
problems may occur and sometimes require your institution's IT team to properly
support EGI check-in through EduGain. For any question ragrding this procedure,
please contact `check-in <at> egi.eu`.
</blockquote>

If you didn't see the list of institutions and (social) platforms, you are likely already logged in.
In this case you can simply select *'SIGN UP'*.

Afterwards, you will have to complete a small registration procedure to connect your account.
You may have to fill out any missing personal information: *Name*, *Email*, *Affiliation* and/or *Organisation*.

<blockquote class="error"><p>Patience required!</p>
Please Wait until your registration is processed and you see the following Banner on top of your screen:
<figure>
    <img src="Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/fig/join0.png" alt="Join EGI user community - process end">
    <figcaption>Join EGI user community - Screen when the process is finished</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>

After submitting the registration form, you will receive a verification e-mail.
The e-mail verification needs to be completed before you can continue with the next steps.

<blockquote class="tip"><p> Note</p>
Within the process, EGI will mention that you got a personal EGI Check-in ID assigned.
You don't need to remember this ID as it is not needed in the following steps.
</blockquote>

### Manage your profile

<!-- in the guide for user -->

<div style="text-align: justify">

As a user, you want to be able to view and update your profile settings, including the security aspects (Passphrase).

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
<img src="Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/fig/profile.png" alt="Sign In"
width="900" height="500" />
</div>

You arrive at this page by clicking on the user's avatar (top right-hand corner of the openEO algorithm plaza portal screen). 
You will be able to see a sub-navigation menu with options (Overview, Security, Team, Organization) and a logout icon.

#### Upgrade to a service provider profile

As a normal user, you wish to use the portal further and begin to develop and publish services, so it will be necessary to upgrade your account to a service provider profile.

This can be done in several ways:
* Click on the ```Create Organisation``` button on the Profile page. More information is available [here](Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/Organisation.md).
* Alternatively, you could ask an Admin or Organisation owner to invite you to their team (if you know someone who is willing to do this).

#### Log out or remove your profile

To log out you can click on the link (or click on the logout icon in the sub-menu).
You can delete the account by clicking on the ```Delete account``` link, which will require user's confirmation before final deletion.

</div>

### Manage your organization

<!-- in the guide for service provider -->

#### Provide your organisation details

Organisations are core elements of the openEO algorithm plaza Portal, as they are the entities that relate users, accesses, services, data, etc. 
One can think of an organisation as a company in most cases, although users can be a one-man organisation.
By default, when a registration is made through the Portal, an organisation is always created with the user that made the registration as the sole user, even if unnamed and with no data.
In a user’s Profile page, they can click on the Organisation option in sub-navigation and arrive at the Organisation page, where they can view and edit the organisation's details, such as:

* Organisation name (mandatory)
* Organisation Identity registration (optional)
* Organisation Avatar / logo URL (optional)
* Organisation description (optional)
* Organisation website (optional)
* Terms of use URL (optional) and other “useful links” e.g., Terms of Service, Privacy, YouTube, and Support URLs
* Update button, disabled by default

#### Invite Team members

You have arrived here after triggering the ```Invite User``` flow through the team screen. You can see a content block to add a new user that contains:
* Email address (Mandatory)
* Name (Optional)
* Role dropdown (Admin, Developer, etc.), defaulting as Developer
* Submit button

You can fill out the fields accordingly and submit the form to invite the new User to your Team and expect a success / error feedback message upon sending it. 
The form should also disappear after successful submission.
You can see the newly invited user in the user list, however, without a Role dropdown and clearly flagged with an “Invitation Pending” message.

## Services

<!-- A short description of services and its maturity level.

Then also guide on use a service/ publish a service and execute a service -->

Within the context of Earth Observation, a service can do anything, from computing a simple Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for a bounding box, to exposing a complex peer-reviewed algorithm with numerous parameters. Of course, you want to keep your target audience in mind, so you may want to hold back on hard to interpret options when you are trying to reach a non-scientific audience.

Once your algorithm is exposed as a service, users will be able to 'invoke' it with a given set of parameters. Within EO, an area of interest and/or time period are very common parameter sets to filter on.

### Service Maturity

Each of the advertised services in the Terrascope openEO algorithm plaza will be assigned a maturity level. This level indicates what end users can expect from the services with regards to:

* Validation of the results
* Stability
* Scalability
* Documentation

Detailed descriptions of the criteria for each maturity level available in openEO algorithm plaza are explained [here](PlazaDetails/ServiceMaturity.qmd).

#### Credit's strength
Credits are deducted based on their chosen services and spatial extent. 
The amount will vary depending on the processing complexity and time required for each type of service.
Depending on the service choice, it can range from 3-60 credits per hectare. 
Detailed examples of some well-known services and how they fit into the 1000 free credits can further be found [here](https://docs.terrascope.be/#/Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/strength).

Moreover, every user is provided with 1000 credits each month, with which they can [execute multiple services](https://docs.terrascope.be/#/Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/Execute). 

 
#### Adding credits
Based on the required credits for executing a service, if you think your available credits are insufficient, there are two ways you can replenish the credits available in your account. 
You can purchase them as a one-time purchase or buy a subscription. 


* **Purchase Credits**

  You can add/purchase a limited credit amount through a one-time payment by clicking on ```Add credits``` button next to the credit score. After choosing among the different credit packs, you are redirected to a payment service to continue payment.
