## Services

Within the context of Earth Observation, a service in openEO algorithm plaza can be any kind of algorithm, from computing a simple Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for a bounding box, to exposing a complex peer-reviewed algorithm with numerous parameters. Of course, you want to keep your target audience in mind, so you may want to hold back on hard to interpret options when you are trying to reach a non-scientific audience. Once your algorithm is exposed as a service, users will be able to 'invoke' it with a given set of parameters. Within EO, an area of interest and/or time period are very common parameter sets to filter on.
