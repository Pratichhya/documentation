The openEO algorithm plaza allows to use and share an algorithm or workflow as a service to the user community. Being an online Application Programming Interface (API) and integrations, openEO algorithm plaza provides a self-service portal through which customers, internal staff, and external providers can interact, publish, and use integrations easily in one place.

From a user's prespective, it simplifies the IT aspects of publishing service so that you can entirely focus on the algorithm's development.The openEO algorithm plaza relies on standardised web interfaces, so our users can easily access your service. A visual description of the service is published to give an attractive overview of the capabilities. Whereas as a service provider, publishing an algorithm as a service will give it greater visibility and expose it to a larger audience who can use them and provide feedbacks.

## Signing in 

<!-- link to documnet showing how to signin, create account, manage your organization and profile. -->
If you haven't previously registered and created an account in Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, you need to click on the ```Register``` navigation option on the main openEO algorithm plaza portal landing page and this will launch the registration flow. Through this flow, any user can login into their registered account after they have successfully validated their email address through the link sent to their email.

Nevertheless, if you have an account you can simply clcik on the ```Sign In``` navigation option. This will lead you to the EGI checkin where you can login using your credential. 

::: {.callout-note} 

In order to use the services on the openEO algorithm plaza, it is advised to use the ```Log in with Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem```.
This will start a one time process to link your Terrascope account to your institution or social media credentials.

:::

We rely on the authentication and authorization service [EGI check-in](https://www.egi.eu/services/check-in/){target=s"_blank"},
provided by the [EGI Foundation](https://egi.eu){target="_blank"}. It allows you to log in not only thorugh your Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem credentials but also through an **existing account** from either your institution or other commonly used (social) platforms such as Google, GitHub, Facebook or LinkedIn.

# Tip: Some background on Security & Privacy.

This procedure has important advantages for users.

## Services

<!-- A short description of services and its maturity level.

Then also guide on use a service/ publish a service and execute a service -->

Within the context of Earth Observation, a service can do anything, from computing a simple Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for a bounding box, to exposing a complex peer-reviewed algorithm with numerous parameters. Of course, you want to keep your target audience in mind, so you may want to hold back on hard to interpret options when you are trying to reach a non-scientific audience.

Once your algorithm is exposed as a service, users will be able to 'invoke' it with a given set of parameters. Within EO, an area of interest and/or time period are very common parameter sets to filter on.

### Service Maturity

Each of the advertised services in the Terrascope openEO algorithm plaza will be assigned a maturity level. This level indicates what end users can expect from the services with regards to:

* Validation of the results
* Stability
* Scalability
* Documentation

Detailed descriptions of the criteria for each maturity level available in openEO algorithm plaza are explained [here](PlazaDetails/ServiceMaturity.qmd).

#### Credit's strength
Credits are deducted based on their chosen services and spatial extent. 
The amount will vary depending on the processing complexity and time required for each type of service.
Depending on the service choice, it can range from 3-60 credits per hectare. 
Detailed examples of some well-known services and how they fit into the 1000 free credits can further be found [here](https://docs.terrascope.be/#/Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/strength).

Moreover, every user is provided with 1000 credits each month, with which they can [execute multiple services](https://docs.terrascope.be/#/Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/Execute). 

 
#### Adding credits
Based on the required credits for executing a service, if you think your available credits are insufficient, there are two ways you can replenish the credits available in your account. 
You can purchase them as a one-time purchase or buy a subscription.
