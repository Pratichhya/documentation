In this page, you'll find all the information you need to manage your account effectively. It covers different tasks like understanding your account settings, upgrading your profile, credit details, organizing your billing account, organizing your team members, and removing your account. This section is designed to help you understand and make the most of the options available to you in order to customize your account and have a better experience with the platform or service you're using.


### Connect an existing account

The next step is to connect your existing account with EGI check-in and become a member of the *EGI User community*.

To get an idea of ​​what this step will require from you,
you can consult the [EGI Documentation](https://docs.egi.eu/documentation/333/users/check-in/signup/), which contains a step-by-step guide with pictures.
If problems occur during this process, feel free to send a support request to `check-in <at> egi.eu`.

<blockquote class="tip"><p>Tip: You have already connected your account in the past?</p>
If you have already done so, you don't need to do so again and you can just continue.
If you don't remember whether you already have connected your account, you can simply try to follow the steps below.
If it is already connected, you will get a warning at the end of the process: "The identifier is already in use".
</blockquote>

To get started, please go to <https://aai.egi.eu/signup>. You will have to select the
institution (recommended) or the (social) platform you want to log in with in the future
and follow the login procedure.

<blockquote class="warning"><p>Recommendation</p>
We recommend using your institutional account whenever possible.
Be aware that if you are the first member of your institution to work with EGI check-in, 
problems may occur and sometimes require your institution's IT team to properly
support EGI check-in through EduGain. For any question ragrding this procedure,
please contact `check-in <at> egi.eu`.
</blockquote>

If you didn't see the list of institutions and (social) platforms, you are likely already logged in.
In this case you can simply select *'SIGN UP'*.

Afterwards, you will have to complete a small registration procedure to connect your account.
You may have to fill out any missing personal information: *Name*, *Email*, *Affiliation* and/or *Organisation*.

<blockquote class="error"><p>Patience required!</p>
Please Wait until your registration is processed and you see the following Banner on top of your screen:

    <figcaption>Join EGI user community - Screen when the process is finished</figcaption>
</figure>
</blockquote>

After submitting the registration form, you will receive a verification e-mail.
The e-mail verification needs to be completed before you can continue with the next steps.

<blockquote class="tip"><p> Note</p>
Within the process, EGI will mention that you got a personal EGI Check-in ID assigned.
You don't need to remember this ID as it is not needed in the following steps.
</blockquote>

### Manage your profile

<!-- in the guide for user -->

<div style="text-align: justify">

As a user, you want to be able to view and update your profile settings, including the security aspects (Passphrase).

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
<img src="Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/fig/profile.png" alt="Sign In"
width="900" height="500" />
</div>

You arrive at this page by clicking on the user's avatar (top right-hand corner of the openEO algorithm plaza portal screen). 
You will be able to see a sub-navigation menu with options (Overview, Security, Team, Organization) and a logout icon.

#### Upgrade to a service provider profile

As a normal user, you wish to use the portal further and begin to develop and publish services, so it will be necessary to upgrade your account to a service provider profile.

This can be done in several ways:
* Click on the ```Create Organisation``` button on the Profile page. More information is available [here](Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/Organisation.md).
* Alternatively, you could ask an Admin or Organisation owner to invite you to their team (if you know someone who is willing to do this).

#### Log out or remove your profile

To log out you can click on the link (or click on the logout icon in the sub-menu).
You can delete the account by clicking on the ```Delete account``` link, which will require user's confirmation before final deletion.

</div>

## Manage your organization

<!-- in the guide for service provider -->

#### Provide your organisation details

Organisations are core elements of the openEO algorithm plaza Portal, as they are the entities that relate users, accesses, services, data, etc. 
One can think of an organisation as a company in most cases, although users can be a one-man organisation.
By default, when a registration is made through the Portal, an organisation is always created with the user that made the registration as the sole user, even if unnamed and with no data.
In a user’s Profile page, they can click on the Organisation option in sub-navigation and arrive at the Organisation page, where they can view and edit the organisation's details, such as:

* Organisation name (mandatory)
* Organisation Identity registration (optional)
* Organisation Avatar / logo URL (optional)
* Organisation description (optional)
* Organisation website (optional)
* Terms of use URL (optional) and other “useful links” e.g., Terms of Service, Privacy, YouTube, and Support URLs
* Update button, disabled by default

#### Invite Team members

You have arrived here after triggering the ```Invite User``` flow through the team screen. You can see a content block to add a new user that contains:
* Email address (Mandatory)
* Name (Optional)
* Role dropdown (Admin, Developer, etc.), defaulting as Developer
* Submit button

You can fill out the fields accordingly and submit the form to invite the new User to your Team and expect a success / error feedback message upon sending it. 
The form should also disappear after successful submission.
You can see the newly invited user in the user list, however, without a Role dropdown and clearly flagged with an “Invitation Pending” message.
