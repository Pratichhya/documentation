<div style="text-align: justify">

As a user, you want to be able to view and update your profile settings, including the security aspects (Passphrase).

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
<img src="Developers/openEO algorithm plaza/fig/profile.png" alt="Sign In"
width="900" height="500" />
</div>

You arrive at this page by clicking on the user's avatar (top right-hand corner of the openEO algorithm plaza portal screen). 
You will be able to see a sub-navigation menu with options (Overview, Security, Team, Organization) and a logout icon.

## Upgrade to a service provider profile

As a normal user, you wish to use the portal further and begin to develop and publish services, so it will be necessary to upgrade your account to a service provider profile.

This can be done in several ways:
* Click on the ```Create Organisation``` button on the Profile page. More information is available [here](ManageOrg.qmd).
* Alternatively, you could ask an Admin or Organisation owner to invite you to their team (if you know someone who is willing to do this).

## Log out or remove your profile

To log out you can click on the link (or click on the logout icon in the sub-menu).
You can delete the account by clicking on the ```Delete account``` link, which will require user's confirmation before final deletion.
