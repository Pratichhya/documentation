Through this flow, any user can login into their registered account after they have successfully validated their email address through the link sent to their email.

In order to use the services on the openEO algorithm plaza, it is advised to use the ```Edugain & social logins```.
This will start a one time process to link your Copernicus Dataspace account to your institution or social media credentials.

We rely on the authentication and authorization service
[EGI check-in](https://www.egi.eu/services/check-in/){target="_blank"}, provided by the [EGI Foundation](https://egi.eu){target="_blank"}. It allows you to log in through an **existing account** from either your institution or other commonly used (social) platforms such as Google, GitHub, Facebook or LinkedIn.

# Some background on Security & Privacy.

This procedure has important advantages for users.

* Neither we, nor the EGI Foundation see, handle or store your password. It is only exchanged directly with your institution or the selected (social) platforms, to minimize the risk of leaking sensitive credentials.
* We only retain minimal information about our users, such as email address and a few more general attributes.
* There is no need to set up and remember yet another username and password.

:::  


## Connect an existing account

The next step is to connect your existing account with EGI check-in and become a member of the *EGI User community*.

To get an idea of ​​what this step will require from you,
you can consult the [EGI Documentation](https://docs.egi.eu/users/aai/check-in/signup/){target="_blank"}, which contains a step-by-step guide with pictures.
If problems occur during this process, feel free to send a support request to `check-in <at> egi.eu`.

# You have already connected your account in the past?

If you have already done so, you don't need to do so again and you can just continue.
If you don't remember whether you already have connected your account, you can simply try to follow the steps below.
If it is already connected, you will get a warning at the end of the process: "The identifier is already in use".

:::

To get started, please go to [https://aai.egi.eu/signup](https://aai.egi.eu/signup){target="_blank"}. You will have to select the
institution (recommended) or the (social) platform you want to log in with in the future
and follow the login procedure.

::: {.callout-warning}

# Recommendation

We recommend using your institutional account whenever possible. Be aware that if you are the first member of your institution to work with EGI check-in, problems may occur and sometimes require your institution's IT team to properly
support EGI check-in through EduGain. 

:::

If you didn't see the list of institutions and (social) platforms, you are likely already logged in.
In this case you can simply select *'SIGN UP'*.

Afterwards, you will have to complete a small registration procedure to connect your account.
You may have to fill out any missing personal information: *Name*, *Email*, *Affiliation* and/or *Organisation*.


::: {.callout-warning}

# Patience required!

Please Wait until your registration is processed and you see the Confirmation Banner on top of your screen.

:::

After submitting the registration form, you will receive a verification e-mail.
The e-mail verification needs to be completed before you can continue with the next steps.

::: {.callout-note}

Within the process, EGI will mention that you got a personal EGI Check-in ID assigned.
You don't need to remember this ID as it is not needed in the following steps.
