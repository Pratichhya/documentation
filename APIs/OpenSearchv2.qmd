The OpenSearch catalogue allows you to search through Copernicus data using a standardized web service. The [OpenSearch specification](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md){target="_blank"} can be consulted for technical details of the standard. This web service returns results as GeoJSON feature collections. Each feature in the collection represents an earth observation 'product', with references to where the actual data can be found.

We remark that this version does not implement the OGC Opensearch standard, and a migration from other API's named OpenSearch may require significant modifications. It mainly offers compatibility for existing users of a similar API on the CreoDIAS and Wekeo platforms, and with client side tools and workflows that have implemented support for this API. For new users looking for a more standardized API, a [STAC](https://stacspec.org){target="_blank"} alternative is being developed.
