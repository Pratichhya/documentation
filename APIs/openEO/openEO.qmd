The openEO API (Application Programming Interface) standardises EO-relatedcontracts between local clients (R, Python, and JavaScript) and cloud service providers regardingdata access and processing, simplifying their direct comparability. Independent of the providersâ€™data storage system, the API mimics the functionalities of a virtual EO raster data cube.  

With such an API,

* each client can work with every back-end, and
* it becomes possible to compare back-ends in terms of capacity, cost, and results (validation, reproducibility)
