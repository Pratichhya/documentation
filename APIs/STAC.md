# STAC product catalog


[STAC API](https://stacspec.org){target="blank"} endpoint: `https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/stac/`

STAC (Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog) is a relatively new web service specification for catalogs that is increasingly used and supported.

The version exposed in the Copernicus Dataspace is still subject to change as the quality of STAC metadata is still improving. Nevertheless,
it already supports basic product search.

There are known issues with using the current version with generic STAC libraries.
