# Sentinel 5P


## Description
The [Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p) mission is the first Copernicus mission dedicated to monitoring our atmosphere. Copernicus Sentinel-5P is the result of close collaboration between ESA, the European Commission, the Netherlands Space Office, industry, data users and scientists. The mission consists of one satellite carrying the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument. The TROPOMI instrument was co-funded by ESA and The Netherlands.

The main objective of the Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission is to perform atmospheric measurements with high spatio-temporal resolution, to be used for air quality, ozone & UV radiation, and climate monitoring & forecasting.

The TROPOMI instrument combines the strengths of SCIAMACHY, OMI and state-of-the-art technology to provide observations with performances that cannot be met by the current instruments in space. Performance of current in-orbit instruments are surpassed in terms of sensitivity, spectral resolution, spatial resolution and temporal resolution. 

There are [different data products](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p/data-products) associated with the three levels of TROPOMI processing: Level-0, Level-1B and Level-2.

Level-0 products are Time-ordered, raw satellite telemetry without temporal overlap, including sensor data of the 4 spectrometers, for both atmospheric and calibration measurements. Also included are engineering (e.g. housekeeping) data, satellite ancillary (e.g. position, attitude) data and acquisition Metadata as required for on-ground processing and monitoring tasks. Level 0 data are not provided to the public.
Level-1B products are geo-located and radiometrically corrected top of the atmosphere Earth radiances in all spectral bands, as well as solar irradiances.
Level-2 products are geolocated total columns of ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and methane; geolocated tropospheric columns of ozone; geolocated vertical profiles of ozone and geolocated cloud and aerosol information (e.g. absorbing aerosol index and aerosol layer height).
